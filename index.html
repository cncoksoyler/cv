        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>I'm an automation and maintenance engineer. I’m leading maintenance processes of fineblanking presses, heat treatement line, injection molding machines and nickel chrome plating line in a multinational company in automative sector. I’m also planning and implementing Industry 4.0 transformation of factory.
            
            I developed programs on different models of Delta, Mitsubishi, Siemens and Omron PLCs, especially with ABB PM564 PLCs. Also I'm experienced in motion control system design especially with TRIO, ABB, Sanyo Denki, Kollmorgen and SEW servo drives.
        
        I also worked as a maintenance responsible and project engineer in a multinational company for a year. I participated the design and implementation stage of whole secondary facilities and production lines from scratch. Also I built up the maintenance unit and maintenance procedures(SMPs', PM/AM Calenders etc) according to WCM standarts. I studied TPM during this period.
        
        Besides that I have my master's degree on computer vision . And I have developed desktop programs of image processing interfaces using .Net C# and Python side line.
